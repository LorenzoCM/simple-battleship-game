# Instructions

This battleship game is very easy and intuitive to use. The project was developed with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. To start this game, simply clone this repository, open the index.html file and HAVE FUN!

I'm currently working on the development of this game in React.js, I hope in some weeks the project could be finished and hosted in my Github account.
